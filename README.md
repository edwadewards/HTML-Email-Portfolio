# My Developer Portfolio
## About

My developer portfolio site! I created this with HTML (of course), Sass, Javascript, GSAP, and <3


## What I Learned From This Project

- GSAP animation library. 
- JS Intersection Observer.
- Sass: this is the first full site I've created with Sass. I really enjoy the added features and took advantage of Mixins to create transition-delays to aid with animations & combined with Bootstrap-like utitlity classes to create easy padding and margin.  


## What I Enjoyed About Creating This

I really improved at writing semantic HTML and responsive CSS. I worked heavily with CSS positioning and DOM manipulatiion and still accomplished it with minimal media queries.
